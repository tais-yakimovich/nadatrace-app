# Product View - Include or Exclude Scrolling Banner Images
US 10

Engagement

Hypothesis: Viewing the description may take slightly too long for customers, or perhaps they'll find the page too cluttered. With less information present on the screen, will more users read the description, or does the image breaking up the page make them more inclined to stay on the page and purchase the product?

Experiment: 50% of the audience will be presented with the banner, while the other 50% will not be.

Variations: Simple variations; a banner is located between the header information (product image, price, name) and between the product description, in one instance. In the other instance, this banner is simply not present.
