# Product View - Include or Exclude Scrolling Banner Images
US 10

Engagement

Hypothesis: Viewing the description may take slightly too long for customers, or perhaps they'll find the page too cluttered. With less information present on the screen, will more users read the description, or does the image breaking up the page make them more inclined to stay on the page and purchase the product?

Experiment: 50% of the audience will be presented with the banner, while the other 50% will not be.

Variations: Simple variations; a banner is located between the header information (product image, price, name) and between the product description, in one instance. In the other instance, this banner is simply not present.


# SignUp/LogIn - 1 Sceen vs 2 Screens
US 4

Adoption, Engagement

Hypothesis: Splitting the signup and login flows into two separate screens will reduce cognitive load and confusion for new users, resulting in a higher signup completion rate and smoother experience compared to a single combined screen.

Experiment: Randomly assign users to the group A with the odler combined screen, and the other group B will be assigned with a new splitted screen. The experiment shown for new users only. Firebase Remote Config and Firebase Analytics will be used to perform the testing and collect data.

Variations: Version A - combined screen: A single screen with both Signup and Login options. Email and password fields shown for both. Button Signup/LogIn changes depends on the tab the user currently on. 
Version B - splitted screen: Users land on a decision screen first with 2 buttons: “I’m new – Create an Account” / “I already have an account – Log In”. Depending on the choice users will be redirected to a SignUp or Login screen.
