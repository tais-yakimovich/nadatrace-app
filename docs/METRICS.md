## Happiness:
* An in-app Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey asking, “How likely are you to recommend this app?”. The data from this survey will be stored in our database (most likely in NPS collection with associated user id for each response).

## Engagement:
* Track Daily Active Users (DAU), metrics that measure activity of each user in the app constantly: total time spent in the app; total number of interactions per user; frequency of sign ups/ log ins/ log outs; number of active users; active users by country; average engagement per user.
Tracked through Firebase.  

## Adoption:
* Download rate: App stores would track this metric, as it does not include actual usage of the app, just the number of users who have downloaded it.
* Product purchases: Shopify will track product purchases, however no products will be purchasable while working on the app.
* Adoption rate: In Firebase, track “First session date” metric and analyze it over periods of time.

## Retention:
* Track the new user and returning users and then display user retention as a percentage. This is tracked through Firebase already.

## Tasks Success:
Task Success ensures users can successfully complete key actions in the app, such as signing up, joining challenges, redeeming rewards, sharing progress, and making smooth purchases. It is measured by tracking completion rates, error rates, time taken, and drop-off points using tools like Firebase analytics.
