## Engagement:
Track Daily Active Users (DAU), metrics that measure activity of each user in the app constantly: total time spent in the app; total number of interactions per user; frequency of sign ups/ log ins/ log outs; number of active users; active users by country; average engagement per user.
Tracked through Firebase.  

## Adoption:
Download rate: App stores would track this metric, as it does not include actual usage of the app, just the number of users who have downloaded it.
Product purchases: Shopify will track product purchases, however no products will be purchasable while working on the app.
Adoption rate: In Firebase, track “First session date” metric and analyze it over periods of time.
